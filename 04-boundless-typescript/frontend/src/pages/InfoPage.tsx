          <p>
            This is a <strong>live demo</strong> of an event-sourced shopping cart application.
            Every action you take — adding items, removing them, submitting your cart — is
            stored as an immutable event. The current state (your cart, inventories, orders)
            is always derived by replaying these events.

            </a>.
            Instead of traditional streams, events are tagged with <strong>consistency keys</strong>{' '}
            — enabling flexible querying across any dimension.
          </p>
          <div className="info-code">
            <p><strong>How it's used here:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>cart</code> key — groups all events belonging to one cart (CartCreated, ItemAdded, ...)</li>
              <li><code>product</code> key — groups pricing and inventory events per product</li>
              <li>ItemAdded has <strong>both</strong> keys — it belongs to a cart AND references a product</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            This means you can query "all events for cart X" or "all events for product Y"
            without maintaining separate streams. The consistency boundaries are defined
            in a simple config, and BoundlessDB handles the rest.

          <h2>🔀 Giraflow — The Event Model</h2>
          <p>
            The entire system was designed using <strong>Giraflow</strong>, a JSON-based
            format for Event Modeling. The model defines every event, command, state view,
            and their relationships — plus specifications (Given/When/Then) that serve as
            both documentation and test cases.
          </p>

          <p>
            The model contains 12 slices — each slice is a vertical feature with its own
            command, events, state views, and test scenarios. The implementation code maps
            1:1 to the model.

            {' '}— a method for describing systems using events as the primary building
            blocks. Instead of starting with database schemas or class diagrams, you model
            the flow of information through time: what events happen, what commands trigger
            them, and what views are derived from them.

            {' '}specification — a modern approach that replaces traditional streams with
            flexible, key-based consistency. Events can belong to multiple
            boundaries simultaneously (e.g., an ItemAdded event belongs to both a cart
            and a product boundary).
